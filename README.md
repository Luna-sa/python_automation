# Task 1: software configuration
## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?
I want to switch to Automation testing and this course looks pretty good as a start for this path. My goal is successfully manage team with QA and AQA members and to understand main principles how to achieve it. 
My expectation is to get clear base for starting in Automation Testing. Thanks for the opportunity!
